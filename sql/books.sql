	('ABYTailoringRec', 'My Theory About Muramites`  by Garald Samer, Master `Tailor```I have been honored to be `master tailor here on the `Queen of Thorns.  I have `been extremely busy, but `Morden has asked us to try `to write our discoveries `down whenever we can.  For `a barbarian, he is `surprisingly interested in `written records.``Adventurers have been `returning to the ship with `these unusual, rune-etched `scales.  They tell me that `they were part of the armor`that these so-called `Muramites wear.  At first I`just shrugged and accepted `that as fact, but now that `I have examined these `scales more closely, I have`some concerns.``They appear to be organic `scales, marked with some `writing or runes that `nobody can decipher.  `That\'s certainly strange, `but that isn\'t what bothers`me.  From what I and others`can tell, these scales seem`to have all come from the `same creature.  Not only `that, but they do not come `from any kind of animal or `being that anyone seems to `recognize.  The coloration `and texture are, well, off.` I can\'t explain it better `than that.``I know leather and skin `better than almost anyone. `My examination of hundreds `of these scales has me very`worried.  From what I can `see, they have all come not`from a single family of `large creatures, but from `one beast in particular.  I`can\'t prove that, of `course, but if I am right, `this is a frightening `concept.``This creature must either `shed scales at a horrifying`rate, or it is so large `that upon killing it, these`Muramites were able to `outfit their entire army `with armor from its scales.` If these creatures killed `a creature of that size, `then I\'m very concerned `about our chances of `defeating them.``There is a positive side to`this, though.  These scales`are a very useful material.` I have been dedicating `myself to studying the `scales themselves, and `between Tonlyei and I, we `have been able to put them `to use.  We have created a `few new whips using these `scales that have potential.` We have tried reinforcing `them with thread made from `the new steel that has been`discovered as well, but we `discovered that the steel `would eventually damage the`whip.  We found that `treating the steel with the`blood of a hynid will `lubricate it well and `reduce the damage.``Of course whips can be made`from cat or wolf pelts, `even the skins of those `horrible brute on Taelosia `will work, but the etched `scales are amazing.  It `takes more skill to create `a whip from the scales, but`the result is worth it.``We have also been working `with the hides of the `Taelosian animals and have `found them to be very good `for making backpacks, `though they are much `stronger if you bind them `with the new steel (treated`properly, of course).  Of `the two types of thread the`smiths have made, one they `call "aligned" and the `other "shimmering" steel, `the shimmering thread is `much stronger, though a `little thicker and harder `to work with.  They also `tend to make it a bit `longer than the aligned `thread.  If used carefully,`I can use less shimmering `steel thread to make a more`durable bag.``I suppose I should return `to work.  It has been nice `to set pen to paper again.`'),
	('ABYTinkeringRec', 'A New Energy Source` by Tialechaety Orrthemech```I am here on the Queen of `Thorns, just outside of `Taelosia.  I have recently `been working with a new `material that has been `recovered from Taelosia.  `As the first to examine `this material, Skelontorim `and I have chosen to name `it Dark Matter.  It is `black and has very little `hint of color or shine.  We`have also discovered that `there are two separate `forms of this material.  `The rarer form has been `infused with some other `matter.  To the best of our`knowledge at this time, `that matter is somehow `linked to the augment `stones, though only `tenuously.  We have named `this form Infused Dark `Matter.``This is a dangerous `material.  It holds power `and improper handling can `be harmful, as Skelontorim `recently discovered.  For `now, our research is `limited but our location, `the supplies and time `available to us.  We have `been asked to attempt only `experiments that we are `certain will not cause any `other large explosions.  We`have, however, discovered a`method for harnessing the `power of Dark Matter.``The key is in the `refinement process.  We `have shared that procedure `with a select few, but I `shall not write it out `here.  Once processed, it `is a relatively simple `matter to divide the Dark `Matter into smaller `portions, any good tinkerer`can do that in her toolbox.` Once you have the proper `amount of matter, just `place it into the battery `casings that we designed `and made available.  These `casings, with the Dark `Matter to power them, can `replace any Mana Battery.  `The only exception is the `larger and more powerful `level six battery.  To `create something to replace`one of these, you must use `the Infused Dark Matter.`'),

I cannot claim any`word of this to be absolute`truth, for the information I`had available was vague,`if not cryptic through the`impenetrable veil of`ignorance and time that`shadowed my vision.`Throughout the whole of`Norrath\'s libraries and`scholars, I was not able to`find a single shred of`evidence or legend relating`to this place. Eerily, it was`as if it had never existed,`that the memory of Norrath`itself had torn Ardathium`from its mind. ``Ardathium - that is the name`of the place I shall detail`as best I can in these pages.`A glorious citadel`constructed by the first`followers of Mithaniel Marr`in what is now known as the`Southern Desert of Ro. I know`for certain that this place`exists, or existed, though in`unfortunate, irreparable ruin`beneath the unforgiving sands`of the desert. I have been`there, and I have seen it.`I cannot tell you where or`how to enter this place, for`I was forced to leave`prematurely during my`investigation of the site.`An earthquake forced me to`escape, or be buried alive`with the city\'s forgotten`dead.

I cannot say when or if`the city will rise again`through the will and labor`of united men and it would be`the wasted energies of a fool`to hope for as much within`our lifetimes.``In the two and a half days`that I was allotted the`opportunity to explore the`standing portions of this`place, I learned so little`and yet, so much. A great`library had once been housed`within the walls of the white`and golden city of Truth.`Though most of the tomes`have dissolved into dust in`the cruel clutches of time, I`was fortunate to find a few`legible documents, preserved`by the desert\'s heat. The`script was ancient, but I`recognized bits and pieces`of the runic tongue of old.`This story is one that I have`concluded to be a possible`fate of Sir Grenic Drere, the`hero of our tale, and the`fate of the city of`Ardathium. `'),
	('Ardathium2', 'In the first years to crown`the Monument Age, the`Fortress of Ardathium was`erected in the northernmost`fields outside the Elddar`Forest. Established by the`half elven paladin, Countess`Viannay, Ardathium would`be the first of the great`monuments established`in the name of Mithaniel Marr`throughout all of Norrathian`history. Dedicated solely to`the crusades of The`Truthbringer in the name of`valor, honor, and truth,`Ardathium was one of`Norrath\'s most beautiful,`though tragically short-lived`treasures. ``Constructed of`pure alabaster stone and`crowned in statues and`tower caps of solid gold,`Ardathium was a sight to`behold. Its white and blue`banners rose high toward the`heavens and the brilliant`glinting of sunlight off of`its tower\'s golden caps could`be seen for miles above the`lush, green canopy of the`Elddar Forest to the south.```The Che Virtuson was`established shortly `thereafter - an elite force `of zealous knights and `priests dedicated to The`Truthbringer and his divine`word. A small commune of `faithful peasants dwelled`within the outer sanctum of`the fortress\' temple, though`the fortress was primarily`governed as a war-front`against the dark evils that`lurked in the eastern swamps`of Innothule and the`Feerrott. Countess Viannay`appointed three Viscounts to`her aid, dubbing each of them`a General of the Che Virtuson`and second in command to`only her dominion over`Ardathium.`Grenic Drere, a human paladin`of Marr who had led several`knights and faithful pilgrims`to Viannay\'s aid during the`first battles with the troll`armies of the east, was among`those appointed to lead at`her side. ``Ardathium would launch`several campaigns against the`massive trollish armies that`dwelled in the swamps of`Innothule to the east.`Countess Viannay\'s fervent`regard of the amphibious`race as a poisonous plague`upon the face of Norrath and`her military prowess in`conjunction with her`unchallenged zealous faith in`The Truthbringer would lead`the Che Virtuson to several`victories over their enemies`-- all the in the name of`Mithaniel Marr. `Unfortunately, Countess`Viannay would not live to`see the end of her life\'s`work and her death would be`the first step toward the`glorious fortress\' demise`several generations later.`'),
	('Ardathium3', 'During one of the greatest`battles that Ardathium had`mounted against the trolls of`Innothule, Countess Viannay`fell terminally ill to a foul`curse placed upon her by one`of the powerful troll shamans,`Tjarduugh. Unable to lead her`armies and confined to her`bed chambers, Countess`Viannay handed the reins of`her armies to the Viscounts`while the high priests`struggled to counter the`curse. After a mere fortnight`of battle, Grenic Drere was`the only remaining general of`the Che Virtuson and the war`had seemed to turn to an`inevitable defeat within the`clutches of the infectious`shadow. His desire to`avenge the Countess was`overwhelming and upon`the final moments of her`life, Grenic vowed to fulfill` Viannay\'s life\'s work.``The Countess\' body was to`be preserved through the`magic of the priests and`laid to final rest in the`grand mausoleum that`housed all of Ardathium\'s`heroes in the highest`tower of the fortress.`In the largest chamber of`the tower mausoleum,`Countess Viannay\'s body`was placed upon a raised`platform of alabaster and`gold. She was dressed in`ceremonial garb of silk and`chain-linked armor and held`beneath her hands, folded`over her breast, was the hilt`of her holy blade. Her body`was covered with Soraviene\'s`Veil - an artifact that would`kill any creature whose faith`was not solely bound to honor`and virtue that dared to`touch it.``With the Countess laid to`rest, Grenic ascended to hold`the title of count over all`of Ardathium. His vow to his`mistress would become the`consuming goal that gave`meaning to his life. Two`massive campaigns would be`launched beneath Grenic\'s`command against the trolls.``The loss of their Countess`had fuelled a passion that`acted as an impenetrable`shield upon all souls of the`Che Virtuson, and they were`victorious. The troll`warlord, a shadowknight`known as Kzurott, and`his forces were pushed out`of the plains upon the`first campaign, and the`second would lead to the`knight\'s demise. However,`this victory would seem`hollow, for Tjarduugh, the`high shaman that had ended`the life of their beloved`Countess, remained and`much of the troll army`still stood.'),
	('Ardathium4', 'No doubt fell upon Grenic\'s`mind that Tjarduugh would`launch an attack that would`more than likely cripple`Ardathium, if not destroy it.`His men were weary and few`amidst their immeasurable`bravery and honor. The attack`could not occur if Ardathium`were to survive, and above`all things, Grenic\'s vow to`Viannay was held in the`foremost of all his`considerations. ``He ordered the pilgrims to`leave Ardathium for their`own safety, vowing to`them that they would hear`word when and if it was`safe for them to return.`The Che Virtuson were`then organized and prepared`to act as mediators of`defense, for to launch an`offensive with such an army`of a mere five hundred`soldiers and priests would be`suicide and inevitably`guarantee Ardathium\'s`downfall. ``Grenic sent a message with`the pilgrims, who had to`travel through the Elddar`forest to reach safety as he`had instructed them to do so.`A small band of the`migrating pilgrims stopped at`one of the elven outposts on`the eastern border of the`forest. There, they left`Grenic\'s message, which`would reach Elwyean in the`halls of Takish\'Hiz.`The great Koada\'Dal wizard`was quick to follow`Grenic\'s request for his`guidance and wisdom,`for this several thousand`year-old elf was the`grand-sire of Viannay and had`given his blessing for`Ardathium\'s construction`outside of the sacred forest.``The news was nothing new to`Elwyean, for Ardathium\'s`impending doom had not`escaped the keen eyes of the`elves. Elwyean advised Grenic`that the destruction of the`swamp would diminish much`of the trolls\' forces and`would leave them in`scattered chaos.`Grenic was hesitant,`though he did not take`Elwyean\'s advice lightly, for`an elf\'s pledge to destroy a`natural niche was not`something uttered in every`lifetime. The elves of the`Elddar believed that the`swamp was corrupt - that the`trolls\' darkness had seeped`into every fiber of the land`and that even the trolls\'`destruction would not uproot`the whole of the evil that`had infected the region. The`wizard informed Grenic that`the swamp would inevitably be`destroyed by the elves, but`it was up to Grenic to decide`whether or not this act would`be one in favor of his city\'s`continued existence, or one`executed after Ardathium\'s`fall.`'),
	('Ardathium5', 'After much consideration and`prayer, Grenic conceded to`Elwyean\'s advice and asked`for his aid, for the`swamplands were immune to`fires kindled by human hands.`The ancient, stoic elf`understood and advised`further that Grenic station`his troops for defensive`purposes, and to destroy the`trolls that dared to flee`toward the forest\'s borders. `Hesitantly, Grenic agreed,`knowing that the act would`undoubtedly leave a mark on`his soul for judgment in the`hereafter. However, his heart`and convictions were steely`upon his promise to the late`Countess and the protection`of the great city and`everything it stood for.``Elwyean briefly returned to`his people to inform them of`the coming destruction of the`swamp. The elves were on`guard for any trolls that`penetrated Grenic\'s forces,`though none left the Elddar`to directly aid the human`citadel. Elwyean\'s return`was heralded in a massive`azure, gold, and red`maelstrom of arcane fires`that erupted across the`swamplands. The magical fire`could be seen for miles`beyond the forest and its`glittering flames raged on`for days. Grenic\'s forces`destroyed hundreds of troll`warriors and civilians that`fled for their lives. ``After twelve long days, the`swamp of Innothule had been`obliterated - the waters`evaporated by the searing`heat of the blaze and even`the most robust of foliage`reduced to pillars of ash.`Elwyean never again returned`to Ardathium or consorted`with Grenic after the battle.`Grenic\'s fortress was safe,`though the cost of this`victory would weigh heavily`upon the knight\'s conscience`and soul for the next`several decades.``Summons were sent back to`the pilgrims that had`previously been sent away.`Most returned, though a few` opted to remain in the new`settlements that had begun`to establish upon the`eastern coast of the`continent. All were welcome`back, though Grenic denied a`celebration in the wake of a`time of mourning for what had`been done.`'),
	('Ardathium6', 'Years would pass and Grenic`would see the prosperity of`his city rise up from the`ashes of its former turmoil.`His remorse and shame`would lift their scars from` his soul and his thoughts`would change to that of`humble acceptance.`Grenic revered what he`had done as a necessity,`for if he had not`given into a tactic that`would otherwise be`dishonorable, all that he saw`before him-the peace and`happiness of his people, the`people of Marr-would have`fallen to damnation and ruin.``The next several decades`would bring prosperity and`peace to the people of`Ardathium. Grenic would`produce a son and daughter,`Erolysia and Mitharius, twin `children who would be`named after the patron`deity and his respected`sister that the fortress`had been founded for.`Upon Grenic\'s death,`Mitharius, a knighted warrior`in the Che Virtuson, would`ascend to Count of Ardathium.`The great leader\'s body`would be taken to the highest`tower in the city and in the`great chamber of Ardathium\'s`Heroes, Grenic\'s body would`be laid to final rest beside`his comrades.  ``Ardathium would experience`nearly a century of`prosperity and peace beneath`the leadership of Grenic\'s`bloodline, though a great`earthquake and the burning of`the Elddar forest would leave`the once-white and golden`jewel of Mithaniel\'s legacy`upon Norrath in irreparable`ruins that would, in the`passing eras, be consumed by`the desert sands of Ro. The`memory of this great city`would be lost as the ages`passed and turmoil wrought`the minds of the modern`cultures.``I hope that these words can`give resurrection to the`memory of this glorious`place - that the descendants`of its survivors and the`scholars of Marr will come`forward and restore the`proper glory and respect to`the memory of a mighty,`though compromised knight\'s`achievements and the history`of Marr\'s first successful`mortal campaign.`'),

I am `pleased to share with all of `you my research thus far on `upgrading Clockwork Watchman `armor into two sets of sturdy `armor more befitting of a `Gnome!  I first noticed that `the need for a set of `Chainmail was needed for the `Shadowwalkers, the assassins `of Ak\'Anon.  To begin with I `needed a set of gears that `would replace the old ones, a `set that would never wear `down.  To make them I took a `normal gear and braced it `inside of my toolbox then `poured Celestial Temper onto `it.  For each gear I did this `to it would suddenly start to `glow and edges sharpen.``Next I would need some temper `to color the armor just the `right hue.  To make it `something to be proud of I `used Minotaur Blood as the `prime ingredient.  I then `added Firewater and Gnomish `Spirits.  After brewing these `three together I got a nice `metallic colored temper.``I then began to work on the `Shadowwalker armor!  Taking `the Clockwork Watchman armor I`placed it inside of a Small `Chainmail Pattern appropriate `to the armor piece.  I then `tinkered an imbued ruby or `imbued black sapphire into the`piece of armor.  All the while`also pouring on the metallic `temper and fitting the imbued `gears into place.  Here is a `list of the number gears `needed for each part:``Coif: Two gears.`Tunic: Three gears.`Sleeves: Three gears.`Bracelet: One gear.`Gloves: Two gears.`Pants: Three gears.`Boots: One gear.``After all that hard work a `full set of Clockwork `Shadowwalker Armor was `created!  Not only was it `reinforced with power but also`it kept the ability of the `original armor piece intact.  `Using a class five battery `will recharge it should the `power run out.``Finally I began to work on the`set of armor that I named `Clockwork Observer\'s Armor.  I`used all the same ingredients `that I did for the `Shadowwalker armor, but `substituted Small Plate Molds `were appropriate.'),

Some parts are vague`on the circumstance of the`speakers that I was quoting.`Other parts were omitted as `they bear little on the `history at hand.]``"See, I lived \'round these `parts then. I was something of`a local hero. Or maybe, `celebrity is a better way o\' `putting it. All right, I was a`well-known drunk. But that `don\'t change a thing of what I`saw in them days; I never got `so stiff that I blacked out, `it was always just enough to `put the edge off a bit, `understand?"``"Anyhow, Cetelt was one o\' `them big time adventurer `types; always slaying orcs and`gnolls and lootin\' em. Always `tellin\' his own tales bigger `than they really was. Now `don\'t get the wrong whiff `here; he was a good fighter. `He could skin a kobold with `one hand and parry the attacks`o\' three orcs with the other, `all the while talkin\' about `how well he was doin\' it. But `truth be told, he wasn\'t one `of the greats; not enough `ambition. He never wanted to `be a prince or king or called `\'highness or majestic like\' or`any o\' those noble style `things. He just wanted to `adventure. At least that\'s how`it was until his sixtieth `year."``[At this point Dremond seemed`to grow a bit melancholy and `began to mumble about`Cetelt\'s early exploits and`how the later years had`caught up to him.`I could not hear these `words well and ask the pardon`of the reader in the matter of`this part of the record being `unclear. I bought Dremond `another flagon and probed him`with this question: What `happened in his sixtieth `year?]``"Whose? Oh, Cetelt. Well, it `was in that year that his `father died, only a few months`after his aunt that had raised`him. He didn\'t seem right `after that. He started calling`for seers and sooths and `whatnot to come to him. This `was when he took up shop in `The Misty Thicket, see? I `dunno why he decide to live `with these halfies, I never `cared for \'em too much, but `hey, who am I to call a thief `a thief?"``"Anyways, you gotta \'member `that Cetelt had built up a `pretty good following of other`adventurers by this time. Now,`Cetty (that\'s wot we called `him behind his back), Cetty `didn\'t have no aspirations of `kinghood or nothin\', but his `followers thought of him as `such and they would do any `thing he asked. They kept `beggin\' him to take over this `land and conquer that. Well, `finally he snapped." ``"He said, and I remember this `well; he said, \'If you fools `want to build something, build`me a castle on Cair Leima.\'  `See, that\'s the little hill `just out of Rivervale."'),
	('CeteltVol2', '"Of course, Cetelt knew it was`too steep for any kind of `foundation, but his boys and `girls they were fanatic like `and tried anyway. Three times `they tried to build there only`to see the whole thing `crumble."``"Cetty said that the only `thing a castle would get him `would be some young punk `looking for a siege. That `reminds me of a joke: There `was this young girl who\'s `father tried to protect her `chastity." [I have omitted `this rather vulgar anecdote to`speed up this narrative.]``"Sooooo, after about a year `Cetelt snaps, like I said, and`calls all o\' his people around`him and sez, \' You all wanna `do something? Then build a `wall. A wall betwixt these `fine people, (meanin\' the `halfies) and the foul breath `of doom that constantly `threatens them.\'  [I think he `meant the goblins of Runny `Eye.]``"So his punks, feverish with `love for the old boy, went a `working. None too fast now. `You gotta \'member, these were`adventurers [said with a `sneer], not real workers like `you and me. So, by the by it `takes \'em fifteen years to `finish this one little wall. `Lazy bastards. Why, in my day `I coulda shown any one of \'em `how the world really works. `Not a one of \'em knew their `arse end from..." [Another `tedious monologue deleted. I `bought more grog for Dremond]``"Well, thash it really. As `shoon as the wall was done, `Cetty took a big long `looky-poo and marched`through the gatesh.`He said., \'Hold these gatesh`for my return.\' `He shouted a few curses and `was gone. Then he headed`into Runny eye and hashn\'t`bin sheen shinze`..ZZzzzzzzzzzzzzz."``[At this point the Halfling `woman that was serving us, `Rollies, was kind enough to `recount her version of the `events]``"Oh, yes, I remember when `Cetelt came here and decided `to retire. He could not seem `to be rid of his hangers-on. `They begged to do some task `for him and he obliged them by`asking that they build a fort `on Cair Leima. I\'m quite sure `that Cetelt, having taken `quite a shine to us wee folk, `was intent on giving this land`some protection from the `goblins that roamed `incessantly here. But Cetelt\'s`people were not architects, `alas. They never could get the`foundation for the fort right `and it tumbled down, again`and again."``"Finally, Cetelt ordered that `a wall be built across the `breadth of the woods. He had `it built tall and strong and `cleared the trees on the bad `side so that the goblins could`be seen coming from quite a `ways."``"Strangely enough though, as `soon as the wall was finished `he shut himself on the bad `side and with a shout of,  \'I `will be rid of this curse!\' `disappeared. It didn\'t take `long for his people to weary `of waiting for him and to `trickle out of these parts; `looking for other adventures, `I would wager."``"Now the wall stands mostly `undefended and the gates are `rotted off. Some still stand `the vigil, but most halflings `have little to do with them. `There are more merry pursuits `here on the edge of `Rivervale."``[Rollies left me then and I `left Dremond to his cups.  The`wall has since come to be `known by the denizens of `Rivervale as the Great Wall of`Serilis, for one of their `gods, though there are many `who remember how it came to `be, and who sometimes call it `by this name.]`'),

	('ColHis1', '` Coldain Heritage and History:`Volume I: Lost at Sea``Inscribed by: `Grand Historian Nicmar``  During the ancient days when`the first city of the dwarves `was under construction, `dwarves were being sent across`the lands and sea to find `precious reserves of stone, `crystal, and ore for the `project. Ships sailed in and `out by the dozens bringing `supplies for the great `project. One fleet of such `ships was sailing across the `South of Antonica to reach the`unknown island that would `eventually be Odus, where a `quartz mine was being set up `in the name of the dwarves. `Led by the miner and explorer `Colin Dain, the fleet of a `dozen ships carrying about 200`dwarves ran into one of the `worst storms Prexus had ever `unleashed. Tossed and turned, `flipped and torn the storm `raged on for days as most of `the dwarves huddled together `in the ships\' holds waiting `for the seas to calm. When `finally after eight days of `turbulence the gales subsided `and the dwarves crawled onto `their tattered decks they `found that six of their ships `had been lost to the storm `along with their crews and `passengers. Worst of all not `even the best of the remaining`navigators or cartographers `had a clue as to where they `were. Even the stars in the `sky could not be relied upon `for navigation, as none of `them were recognizable to the `dwarves who had never been in `this region before.'),
	('ColHis2', '` Coldain Heritage and History:`Volume II: A New World``Inscribed by: `Grand Historian Nicmar``  Using typical dwarven logic,`Colin picked a direction to `sail in and decided that their`only hope was to keep sailing `in that direction until they `spotted land. As the days and `then weeks went by the only `noticeable difference to the `dwarves was that things began `to get a lot colder. Some `nights were so cold that many `a dwarf froze to death on the `decks, turned into a guardian`statue of ice by the cruel `weather. Only the morale `boosting and determination of `Colin Dain kept the dwarves\'`hopes alive as he popped from `ship to ship assuring the `dwarves that they would "Hit `land soon, if\'n not tommorow `then the day after." `Eventually Colin\'s words rang `true as the dwarves did indeed`spot a gigantic white landmass`in the distance. Unfortunately`the landing proved to be as `deadly as the voyage there as `a reef of icebergs both small `and large begin to tear the `small fleet apart. Not a `single ship made it to what `could only be thought of as a `giant glacier intact. Most `were torn apart far from the `land, and many of the `remaining dwarves met with icy`deaths in the heart of the `ocean. All in all ninety-four `of the two hundred some `dwarves who left from the `Northern Hemisphere countless `days before made it onto that `icy beach. Not a single ship `was serviceable. `  Colin Dain wasted no time in`leading his people from the `shoreline. He knew that  they `would have to find shelter to `keep from dying in the cold. `He also knew that they would `need to find wood and other `supplies so they could repair `the remaining ships and  set `off for fairer lands. And so `the quartz miners from the `north settled in a nest of `abandoned caves found about `ten miles inland from where `they landed, in the side of a `giant mountain of ice and snow`in the northernmost tip of the`Great Divide.'),
	('ColHis3', '` Coldain Heritage and History:`Volume III: Froststone Keep``Inscribed by: `Grand Historian Nicmar``There\'s an old Erudite saying `that states, "Dwarves are like`time itself, neither can ever `remain idle." This certainly `proved true for the new `settlement. The miners quickly`discovered that the hard-`packed ice lying beneath the `snow of Velious was as durable`and malleable as stone. Being `mostly quartz miners, the `dwarves found they liked this `ice just fine and were `building all sorts of things `with it in no time. The great `walruses found along the coast`proved to be an invaluable `source of food and furs, `although many a warrior fell `to the beasts thinking `"they\'re just dumb animals." `It was for this reason and `others that a small dwarven `settlement was formed near the`shores of the ocean in the `Eastern Wastes. Through time `the settlement became a town, `and then a strong dwarven keep`seemed to form as if a new `mountain had been born. Named `Froststone, for the ice it was`built from, the dwarves `realized that with the `completion of this keep their `stay on this strange new land `was permanent. `Unfortunately this time of `peace for the dwarves was `coming to an end as they ran `into the first other `intelligent life on Velious, `the frost giants.'),
	('ColHis4', '` Coldain Heritage and History:`Volume IV: Our Greatest Loss``Inscribed by: `Grand Historian Nicmar``  The frost giants make up the`largest population in the `Eastern Wastes and consider `those lands their home. `Needless to say they did not `take kindly to the children of`Brell building a fortress `along their northeastern `border. And so it was with `great surprise that the `dwarves woke up one day to `find their home under siege by`an army of giants. After days `of vicious battle the dwarves `realized that they could not `possibly hold out against the `giants. Colin Dain led the `exile from their new home in `the Great Divide to the only `place they could go - deeper `into the mountains. The ice `giants followed them into the `mountains and a small group of`dwarves volunteered to stay `behind while the others `escaped. Colin Dain himself `led the suicide ambush, buying`his people enough time to `escape the giants\' reach. From`this time onward the dwarves `vowed to refer to themselves `as the Coldain in honor of `their beloved leader, and also`that all the leaders of their `people would carry the title `Dain. From this day forward `the Coldain were a new people `born from the roots of dwarven`kind. This event also `established an enemy of the `Coldain that will most likely `remain until the end of time.`  As for Froststone Keep `itself, all that remains are `ruins in the Eastern Wastes `marking the remnants of a once`great citadel.'),
	('ColHis5', '` Coldain Heritage and History:`Volume V: The Crystal Caverns``Inscribed by: `Grand Historian Nicmar``  While hiding out in the `frigid caverns, a Coldain `miner by the name of Glight `Snowchipper received a vision `from Brell. The vision was of `a labyrinth of ice where the `dwarves could hide from the `ice giants. These caverns `would be a twisting maze so `that the invading giants would`become easily lost and fall `into the many deathtraps the `dwarves would set up. These `caverns of crystal would be `the salvation of the Coldain `race. ``  And so Glight presented his `idea to Dain Frostreaver the `First, son of Colin Dain and `called Frostreaver for his `efficiency in dispatching `giants, and construction `began. The Crystal Caverns `were completed in a little `under half a century. The `timeliness of the project `alone was proof to the Coldain`that Glight had indeed been `inspired by Brell. The true `test of the caverns\' `effectiveness came 30 years `later when the Kromrif `discovered the location of the`Crystal Caverns. Slagd `Frozentoe of the Kromrif led `an invasion force of two `hundred and fifty warriors to `the cavern, hoping to wipe the`hated Coldain from Velious `once and for all. Glight `Snowchipper himself led the `defense of the Coldain leading`the ice giants deep into the `confusing caverns. His magical`pickaxe, aptly named `Snowchipper, split many a `giant\'s kneecap as the dwarves`struck repeatedly from hidden `passages and around dimly `lit corners. Despite losing `more than two thirds of his `forces, Slagd and the `remaining giants had almost `made it to the Coldain city in`the center of the caverns when`Glight pulled off his greatest`and final trick. Thirty `thousand tons of ice and stone`crashed into Slagd and his `remaining giants after Glight `and a few of his brave miners `led them down a false passage.`Unfortunately it was an act of`self-sacrifice as the dwarf `and his fellows were also `buried in the intentional `avalanche.'),
	('ColHis6', '`Coldain Heritage and History:`Volume VI: The Second Exodus``Inscribed by: `Grand Historian Nicmar``  Over the centuries that `followed, strange creatures `began migrating into the `Crystal Caverns. These `monsters were a collection of `the most deadly cave dwellers `who inhabited the frosty caves`of Velious. Unfortunately for `the Coldain, these monsters `used stealth and camouflage to` hunt their prey. The crystal `widows are a breed of `arachnids that are almost `entirely translucent and `blend in with the walls of the`crystal caverns catching many `an unwary miner with their `poison glass fangs. `Stalagterrors are particularly`nasty hunter which `appears to be an ordinary ice `stalactite, launching their `frosty tentacles and opening `their icy maws only when their`prey is within reach. It was `these foes and more which `eventually caused the dwarves `to abandon the Crystal Caverns`and set out to build a new `fortress more akin to Frost-`keep. There are rumors that a `few dwarves refused to leave `their home in the center of `the Caverns but what has be-`come of them is unknown.'),

I can`only assume that we humans`are as strange to them as`they are to us.`My companions and I`will attempt to charter `passage on one of the trading `vessels as soon as we have `secured the necessary `provisions for the journey.``Journal Excerpt Two``Never have I dreamt of a body `of water so vast as the Ocean `of Tears, although my home `city of Qeynos rests against `the western coast of Antonica `I have never voyaged upon a `ship for such great distances `and so far from any visible `coastline. The traders that we`have purchased passage`from recount tales of`several Islands that have`been visible in the distance`through the ocean mist`and fog. They spoke of an`island of elven women that `slay any man who sets foot on `their sacred shores, of `goblins that live in the `shallows and underwater `caverns, and of one-eyed `giants that hunt sharks like `our fishermen hunt fish. There`are even tales of lost ships `that haunt the ocean, manned `by crews of the dead. How`much truth there is to any`of the tales is questionable`but if anything, they make`for entertaining stories to`pass the time at sea.``Journal Excerpt Three``The ship that carries my `companions and I has docked`on the shore of a region`called the Butcherblock`Mountains. Apparently this`is the homeland of the`Dwarves, a race of short,`stocky, gruff, and hairy`people with a fondness`for battle and beer.`I\'m afraid I have not much in `common with these dwarven`folk but the warriors of my`company seem to have`taken a liking to them.`There are none among us`who speak their language but`a few of the dwarves that`reside near the docks have`learned enough of our`human tongue to answer`basic questions we have`presented to them, and`beneath their gruff and`rugged mannerisms they`seem to possess a great`deal of `patience.`'),
	('ErudJourn2', 'Journal Excerpt Four``The dwarves have been kind `enough to invite us to their `home city of Kaladim, a rather`stuffy and cramped `subterranean city built into `one of the taller mountains of`the Butcherblock range. The `most impressive sight so far `has been the enormous statue`that has been carved into the `very side of the mountain. `Apparently it is the visage of`a great dwarven king. Some of `our company has taken a liking`to the strong brews of the `Dwarves. I fear it may be time`to move on before their minds `get dulled by the intoxicating`substances, and the `oppressiveness of being `constantly surrounded by`stone and the clatter of the`mines echoing through out`the caverns is wearing on my`sanity.``Journal Excerpt Five``My company has left the `dwarven capitol of Kaladim`and now journeys into the`deep forests of the Faydark,`home of the elves.`We have had the fortune`of hiring a scout and `translator for our journey `into the lands of the elves. `It seems this odd individual, `Tolsarian, is a Half-Elf, I `had heard of the union`between an elf and human`but have never before`actually had the`opportunity to meet one. I`found Tolsarian to be a very `intelligent individual and he `possessed a vast knowledge`of the Faydarks and its many`inhabitants. Tolsarian spoke `little however of his `heritage, he spoke of the `humans and elves as if neither`were his people, and I sensed `a deep sadness in his `demeanor. Tolsarians spirits `did seem to lift a bit when we`reached the tree city of the `wood elves, the Fier\'Dal I `believe it was that Tolsarian `called them, and were greeted `by an elven maiden that `appeared before us as if she `had stepped forth from the `very bark of the tree before `us.``Journal Excerpt Six``I\'ve found my stay in the tree`city of Kelethin much more `pleasing than my stay in the `stifling halls of Kaladim. `Some of my company do not `agree with my pleasure, they `find the wine of the elves to `be far less enjoyable than the`rich brews of the dwarves.`These drunkards in my`company have such simple`minds to base so much of`their enjoyment off the`imbibing of intoxicating`beverages. These Fier\'Dal are`a strange people, even `stranger to me than the`dwarves. The dwarves are`blunt of speech and manner`and their simple ways are`easy for even the weakest`minded of my companions`to understand. The Fier\'Dal` however are puzzling.`I have no doubt that they are `an intelligent people but they`are uninterested in`scholastics and conventional `knowledge. Instead these aptly`named Wood Elves are`frivolous and mysterious,`spending all their time`sneaking about the forests,`caring for its wild beasts,`and singing and dancing`in their tree top city.`Their history and lore `seems to be told mostly in `folklore and poetry, though `they have a written language, `which according to Tolsarian, `is shared with their relatives`the High Elves. They are `however, a good people, and `there is wisdom in their `poetry and song.`'),
	('ErudJourn3', 'Journal Excerpt Seven``Our friend Tolsarian has led `us from Kelethin deeper into `the Faydark to the High Elf, `or Koada\'Dal as they are `called in their own tongue, `city of Felwithe. I must say `compared to the tree city of `Kelethin, Felwithe is indeed a`splendid sight to behold. It\'s`white walls and palaces `soaring high above the canopy `of the forest. I am surprised `to find that the Koada\'Dal are`much taller than their `Fier\'Dal relatives, their `complexion is much paler and `their hair and eyes the colors`of the stars and skies instead`of the earth and trees. We `received a far less hospitable`welcome to the city of the `High Elves than we had `received in Kelethin. The`guards at the cities gate`questioned Tolsarian for quite`some time and looked over`each member of my company`thoroughly before admitting us`within the outer walls. Once `inside the city proper it`became apparent that while`the Feir\'Dal are wise, the`Koada\'Dal are the intelligent`branch of the elven family. I `have beheld wonders in this `city beyond any I have `imagined. In the northern `quarter of the city is a tower`where the elven sorcerers `study and store their magical `tomes. If only I could gain `admittance to the tower and `browse the texts myself.``Journal Excerpt Eight``A member of my company has`acquired a set of High Elven `tomes that he claims have`come from the tower of the`Keepers of the Art, the`name the Koada\'Dal sorcerers`have given to themselves.`He has not mentioned how`the books came to be in his`possession and I dare not`ask until we are far beyond`the gates of this city.`Tolsarian has agreed to take `us through the Faydark to the `borders of the Steamfont `Mountains, home of the`Gnomes, creatures of distant`relation to the dwarves of `Butcherblock. I do not look `forward to another stay in a `subterranean city but from `what I have heard of the`gnomes, the discomfort may`be rewarded with knowledge`pertaining to my interests. I`am also eager to be away`from the condescending`nature of the Koada\'Dal,`despite the magnificence of`their city and the wonders`they possess.`Some of my company find`my reaction to the demeanor`of the high elves to be amusing but I do not share`in their humor.``Journal Excerpt Nine``The Steamfont Mountains are `unlike any mountain range I `have beheld. Great geysers `jettison steam and scalding `water into the air and mist `and fog blankets the ground `and sky. Tolsarian has left `our company for the time`being and will await our`return at a small elven`outpost in the Faydark not`far from the borders of`Steamfont. I have begun`research to decipher the`texts that were acquired in `Felwithe but fear that what `few tomes I have brought with `me on the journey are not `sufficient for proper study `and I will not likely make `much progress with the elven `texts until I am able to `return to my study in Qeynos.`'),
	('ErudJourn4', 'Journal Excerpt Ten``My company and I have arrived `and been welcomed to the `Gnomish city of Ak\'Anon, and I`must say, of all the things I `have seen on this journey the `city of the gnomes is the most`perplexing.

Unlike the high `elves of Felwithe, the gnomes `are eager to show my `companions and I the marvels `they have created, and are far`more curious about our past, `stories, and belongings than `any other peoples we have `encountered here in Faydwer.`I believe the gnomes attitude `toward my company will allow `me to inquire about their `magical practices and perhaps`even view the tomes they have `catalogued in their sorcerers `academy, The Library `Mechanamagica.``Journal Excerpt Eleven``A gnome magician of the `Eldrich Collective, the name `given to their arcane order, `has allowed me entry to the `Library Mechanamagica and `given me quick instruction on `the basics of the gnome `language. In exchange for `allowing the Eldrich `Collective to examine the `elven tomes I acquired in `Felwithe they are giving me `several copies of gnomish `arcane books containing `theories and practical `applications of the magical `arts. I am grateful that my `journey has led me to the `gnomish city despite my `original apprehension and `assumption that they would be `more similar to their distant `relatives the dwarves. It is `apparent that the gnomes are `highly civilized and extremely`intelligent, but I fear they `are a bit too trusting of `outsiders and that congenial `trait may one day cause them `to suffer. In a few days time `my company and I shall once `again meet up with the `half-breed Tolsarian and he `shall escort us back through `the Faydark and Butcherblock `Mountains to the docks so that`we may charter passage on a `ship back to Antonica.

Rumors circled `like hungry buzzards over a `field of carnage concerning `the plans for this second `invasion. It was even said `that Rallos Zek was to lead `the campaign with Warlord `Murdunk and the most`renowned champions of`the Giants, Orcs, and`Goblins by his side. Once `again my orders were to`remain at the home front`to defend the women,`children, and elderly`citizens of the Rallosian`Empire.`It was not long after the `invasion forces of the `Rallosian Legions once again `passed through the portals to `the Planes of Power that the `home front too became a place`of battle, slaughter, and `glory. Mortal disciples of `deities opposed to The `Warlord, Rallos Zek, attacked `the citizens and fortresses of`the Rallosian Empire on `Tunaria. Our enemies fought `valiantly, and the resulting `battles were the most glorious`I was ever to behold. My `weapons and armor were` stained with the blood of`our foes, and our children`and elders kept safe within`our impenetrable strongholds.`Messengers passing through`the Fortress of Krithgor spoke`of the victories of the legion`units led by Rallos Zek, `Warlord Murdunk, and the `Generals Tallon and Vallon. It`was said that the Rathe `Council, the twelve rulers of `the Plane of Earth had been `captured and forced to Norrath`where they were being executed`by Murdunk and his Generals, `that mountains burst from the `earth where the gods fell and `that the dying tears of the `fallen gods formed a cold, `deep lake between the newly `risen mountain peaks.`'),
	('GromokVol2', 'At the height of victory it `happened, I know not what `fearful deities are`responsible, nor what ancient`magics were unleashed on`my people and our brethren`races of the Rallosian Empire.`I know only what I myself `witnessed at the accounts of `the other survivors of what is`spoken of only as The Curse.`The first signs I saw of the `curse were the angry shouts of`the ogre magi when the planar `portals closed. Then the `screams of those same magi`as fire simultaneously`ignited from within their`bodies leaving only memories`and ashes.`Shortly after witnessing the `demise of the magi stationed `at the Fortress of Krithgor a `battered legion unit arrived `at the fortress gates. The `soldiers brought word of `Murdunks dishonorable death, `accusing The Rathe of cursing `Murdunk to fall from a cliff `at the site of The Rathes `execution. They spoke of the `disappearances of many great `Ogre war leaders, including `Murdunks tactician and `strategist, Generals Tallon `and Vallon, and even the `Warlord Rallos Zek. This worn `unit of soldiers was relieved `of their previous duties by `our superiors and stationed at`the Fortress of Krithgor. A `new Legion Unit was formed `from the soldiers that had `been stationed there for some `time, myself included, and we `were charged with completing `the duties of the reassigned `soldiers.`Days passed swiftly for me as`my legion unit traveled to `various fortresses and`battlefields. The sights`revealed to us at each arrival`to this day seem unreal. With`the great military leaders and`the magi dead or missing our`fortresses began to fall. The`Giants, also crippled with the`loss of their magi, retreated`deep into the wilderness. The`Orcs became obsessed with`greed and blood lust, dividing`from the Rallosian Empire into`petty clans fighting each`other over the spoils of the`war. The Goblins went mad`cowering in the shadows and`caverns of Tunarias frontiers.`We returned after many`months to the Fortress of`Krithgor to find the once`mighty stronghold reduced`to rubble like so many of the`fortresses we had visited on our patrol.`Whatever creatures had `destroyed the fortress had not`even spared women and`children, their remains lay `strewn about the stones that `once formed the strongholds`walls. This was when I gave in`to my pride and accepted that`the Rallosian Empire was no`more.`'),
	('GromokVol3', 'Freed of any obligations of `duty, the soldiers that`accompanied me and I set out `in search of a fortress that `had not yet fallen. We`traveled and fought for `countless weeks only to be`greeted by death and misery at`each destination, what`survivors did remain at the`ruined strongholds of our once`great empire often joined us `in our search for sanctuary or`at the very least a place to `rebuild our fallen society.`Gradually as we traveled `across Tunaria, what began`as a small unit from the`Fortress of Krithgor became`a large caravan of refugees.`We settled in the Feerott`Marshlands near the ruins of`one of the Rallosian Empires`greatest strongholds. A `handful of capable warriors `among us set out to the west `in search of survivors at the `locations of the Rathes `executions and the death of `Murdunk. Only two of the `search party returned alive. `They spoke of terrible `devastation, Giants that were `once allies of the Ogre people`attacking without provocation,`and of ferocious one-eyed `giants that now guarded the `valleys and canyons of the `Mountains of the Rathes `Demise.`So it came to pass that the `Feerott Marsh became the new`home of we, the Ogre people.`The men took on duties of `hunting food in addition to `protecting the women and `children from the wild beasts `of the marsh. The women`harvested and cultivated what`forms of crops could be grown`in the marshy soil. The `children did nothing, and this`instilled fear into our minds `and hearts.`The children born to us`survivors of the collapse of `the Rallosian Empire were`noticeably and frighteningly `different than children of`previous generations. This`new generation of Ogres was`for the most part hairless,`only females showed any`ability to grow hair and even`then it was thin and straggly.`The flesh of the youngsters`was of a paler complexion`and warty and course,`they suffered frequently from`conditions that turned their`eyes bloodshot, made their`noses runny, and they often`drooled incessantly. It soon`became apparent however`that these physical conditions`were the least of our worries`for they were still physically`strong and enduring. It was`their minds that concerned us`the most.`'),
	('GromokVol4', 'The new generation of Ogres`exhibited little to no`capacity to learn all but the `most menial of tasks. The `youngsters proved to be `incapable of understanding the`written languages and they `struggled with speech, often `communicating in grunts and `barely comprehendible babble.`We were hard on the first few `children of this new `generation. We did not yet `fully understand what was `happening and placed them in `dangerous situations or left `them stranded in the marsh to `fend for their own survival.`As time passed and our colony`dubbed Oggok, a word that the `youngsters could remember`and enunciate, grew in numbers`it became apparent to us`adults that a great curse had`been laid upon our offspring.`Every child being born`exhibited the same physical`and mental characteristics of`those first few of the new`generation. `Gone were the days of the `Rallosian Empire. No longer`would there be heroic olive`skinned warriors, their`dreadlocks adorned with`bones of their enemies,`brilliant minded tactitions`and strategist to ensure our`victories, or magi to wield`fierce magic and open portals`to even the realms of the Gods`themselves. I am old now, an`elder of my people because I`am among the last of the `pre-curse generations. I leave`these words that I now ink in `the care of the most astute of`the new generation Ogres, I`pray that they will endure `after I have gone to join`Rallos in the afterlife,`perhaps The Warlord will shed`some hope on my despair and`provide some answers as to`why his glorious Empire has`fallen.``---- Elder Gromok Hergom, `former soldier of the `Rallosian Legions.`'),

We slowly made `our way down to his lair.  We `were not after the gold, only `the more unique treasures.  `Lord Nagafen must have just `finished off a group of `adventurers because he was `sleeping near his gold hoard. `His snoring was so loud it `rattled the walls, and his `exhales filled the chamber `with flame.

He assured them`everything was all right, and`told them that he needed to`get some rest. Little did`they know what dark plans`were about to unfold. In the`dead of night Toluwon crept`around and slit the throats`of each priest within the`temple. Then performing a`dark ritual told to him by`the priests of Bertoxxulous`he desecrated the newly`erected temple. Toluwon had`now become a full-fledged`member of Bertoxxulous\'`clergy.

The`residents of the old city`once conducted experiments`on the Living Stone,`attempting to find a way to`harness its power. The`experiments damaged the wall`of Living Stone and creatures`began to breach the wall and`threatened the city. The`Erudites constructed The`Hatch, a sort of life support`system that kept the Living`Stone strong after the`earthen Lord Yael escaped`and threatened their`destruction with his army`of elementals.``Ognit sought to study both`The Hatch and the wall of`Living Stone. He felt that`the Erudites were simply not`qualified for that sort of`study and indeed it would`take the delicate and careful`touch of a gnome to properly`study the artifact and`perhaps find a way to harness`its power. History has a way`of repeating itself.``Ognit considered the first of`his experiments successful.`He found that the wall of`Living Stone was able to`release enormous amounts`of power, as evidenced by`the tremendous earthquakes`he was able to cause simply`by infusing the Hatch with`just a small amount of`magical energy. Indeed, it`seemed the two worked`together like a transformer,`turning small amounts of`energy into tremendous`surges of power. Though he`had no idea how one could`harness the released energy,`he was impressed with the`results nonetheless.``Dagda was terrified and`believed that the gnome was`tinkering with powers beyond`his comprehension. She`threatened to leave them both`down there, particularly when`the experiments began to`cause earthquakes of greater`and greater magnitude.`Against her better judgement,`she stayed. ``Ognit saw the greater`earthquakes as a sign that`his experiments were going`well. He was getting even`better power output for the`same amount of energy.`Dabner eventually began`to become frightened too`and started to side with`Dagda, urging the wizard`to abandon the experiment.`Ognit was incensed and`no amount of convincing`would deter him from`his experimentation.`'),

The Erudite was`walking slowly and limping`slightly. He was filthy,`covered with dirt and soot.`His skin was pallid, as one`who had not stood under the`glare of harsh sunlight for`ages.

The tribes of the Dawn`and Moon established the`laws of the wild: none of`Wegadas\' tribe was to`leave the forest, and if`they attempted to do so,`they would be killed.`They were children of`the wild now, and their`attempts to see the outside`world would corrupt them.`The Tribes of the Dawn and`Moon also established that`all who entered the forest`would be driven out or`destroyed at the discretion`of Wegadas and the tribe. ``The third law was that the`Lujien and Gihjna would`remain out of the human`tribe\'s affairs - so long as`they maintained the order the`Gihjna had given the`generations past, and that`they did not stray from`their duties to the forest`that has accepted them as its`children. ``The laws were agreed upon`with Wegadas\' leadership, for`the human tribe trusted his`wisdom and guidance`explicitly.

In her appreciation`for the human tribe\'s`devotion to her and in`honor of her missionary,`Wegadas, she molded his`spirit and essence into the`great, beautiful willow that`eternally weeps the tears of`joy and sorrow of the tribe.``With her father\'s passing`and the appearance of the`great willow, Elaryness, the`only daughter of Wegadas,`would rightfully challenge`four others - two of whom`were her half-brothers- who`had made the declaration for`leadership in Wegadas\' stead.`The brutal, ceremonial`battles would last days at a`time, where those who vied`for leadership would hunt one`another throughout the whole`expanse of the woods.`Elaryness would destroy her`challengers and the tribe,`now beneath her rule, would`move their bodies to the very`location where Wegadas`himself had laid to final`rest.

	('Mujaki1', 'Mujaki the Devourer, as chronicled by Sage Unimvariea of the Gatecallers of Erudin ``Mujaki was born the first child to Erudite couple: Mage Tevrai and Cleric Etumara. His father, Tevrai, had high hopes for a son to follow in his footsteps and become a powerful wielder of magics. However, Mujaki seemed to lack the spark for magical pursuits early on. Much to his father\'s chagrin, little Mujaki liked to play more and had a physical affinity for the world around him, not a magical one. ``The couple, Tevrai and Etumara, looked forward to bringing another child into the world, but met with little success. Whatever ailed Etumara after her first birth did not allow her to conceive again. This was a serious point of consternation for Tevrai, who desired another heir who might carry on his magical research. It was a notable point of shame for Etumara. She found comfort in the church of Prexus, focusing on helping those she could there when she could not please her husband. This grew a rift between the couple and for several years they existed in a somewhat detached, distant relationship. ``All of this was lost on young Mujaki, save that for some reason he did not please his father and his mother was often less than happy. This weighed heavily on the young mind, planting seeds of guilt and inadequacy. As he grew in his childhood, Mujaki was often found at his mother\'s side in the church of Prexus and was a source of comfort and solace for her as she delighted in his advancement in the "lesser" arts, as his Father would say. ``As Mujaki approached the age of 7, his parents rejoiced as Etumara was again with child! Her infertility seemed to have been overcome. Tevrai was nearly obsessed with the possibility of a magically adapt heir. Young Mujaki simply looked forward to the promise of another playmate. However, as the pregnancy progressed, it was clear that it would not be a smooth one. Etumara was not carrying the child well and complications developed late in the term. As fate would have it, Etumara would deliver to Tevrai a beautiful baby boy adept in magics, but at the cost of her own life. ``Tevrai\'s sorrow knew little in the way of bounds, and his anguish turned to self blame for it was he who had so desired another child. It was only the responsibility for his new son that focused his attention enough to keep Tevrai from destroying himself in his mourning. The infant was named Etumer in memory of his mother.``Mujaki was crushed nearly as much as Tevrai. However, with little love coming from his Father, he found solace in the support of the clerics of Prexus and his mothers many friends there. Despite his best understanding of what happened, Mujaki could not help but harbor blame on his infant brother for taking his mother from him. ``As the years passed Etumer would greatly please his father with his aptitude for the magical arts and further alienate Mujaki from the family. Despite this rift, Mujaki still looked to his father for acceptance and worked exceedingly hard to prove his worth to Tevrai. He would devote his life to the ways of Prexus and became a devout Paladin to the Ocean Lord. ``As Mujaki entered into manhood, he became attracted to the young Lady Yuntair, a magician who had gained an early reputation as exceedingly skilled in magic. ```At the same time that a relationship was developing between Yuntair and Mujaki, Etumer was discovering something wonderful, powerful and innately sinister: the ways of necromancy. Initially introduced as something innocent and an outgrowth of his regular magical studies, Etumer was seduced by the easy power that necromancy offered. He could not hold these discoveries from his Father. This infected Tevrai with what started as an innocent step in a logical evolution of study and turned into something foul and seductive in its possibility for power.'),
	('Mujaki2', 'Even when the root principles `of The Faceless, Cazic Thule, `were revealed by Etumer\'s dark`friends, it was sufficiently `clouded in righteous logical `posturing to not sway the son `or his over ambitious father `from delving deeper into new `possibilities.  ``Heady with newfound power and `possibilities, Etumer was `introduced to Mujaki\'s `acquaintance, the lovely Lady `Yuntair.  Smitten by her `radiant beauty and `subconsciously infected by his`father\'s contempt for Mujaki, `Etumer went about making `inroads with Yuntair.  Playing`out the same seduction that he`had with his father, Etumer `swayed Yuntair by appealing to`her magical questing for `power.  ``Mujaki was tormented by his `position.  He languished in `indecision of what to do, `stymied by his own iron grip `of the church\'s principles `coupled with his deep-set `feelings of inadequacy toward `his family.  This started a `plague of dreams that `tormented him with `possibilities of what may `happen should he not find a `way to repair his many down `fallings.``By the time Mujaki moved to `salvage his relationship, he `was too late.  Initially, he `uncovered his brother\'s `treachery by stumbling upon `Etumer and Lady Yuntair in a `very questionable situation, `further compounded with `evidence of necromancy.  `Thunderstruck, Mujaki could `only flee the scene, battling `with his inner feelings and `duty-bound honor to reveal the`necromancy to the Erudin `authorities.  Mujaki `approached his father for `guidance, only to be spurned `with statements alluding to `Etumer\'s superiority in `ability, despite the deficit `of his age.  Tevrai reasoned `that Etumer should rightfully `win the Lady Yuntair over `Mujaki.  ``This, coupled with his `father\'s casual dismissal of `the Necromancy, slapped `Mujaki\'s ego down and spiraled`him further into self `questioning.  Grappling with `what to do, he pondered and `paced in inactivity.  `Throughout this, his sleep was`wracked by the sendings of `Terris Thule, who delighted in`twisting the knives of his `situation deeper into his `psyche.  ``Pushing his own teachings `aside and seeking acceptance `at the cost of his own `principles, Mujaki returned to`his Father seeking guidance `into magics and even the `teachings of necromancy if `only he could find favor from `his father and use this `knowledge to impress Yuntair `to reciprocate his unrequited `love.  While this seemed to `improve the situation for a `time, it ultimately alienated `him from the one stability in `Mujaki\'s life: the church of `Prexus.``The situation came crashing to`calamity as Mujaki stumbled in`on his Father, Brother and `Lady Yuntair, along with `several of Etumer\'s friends, `engaged in debased necromantic`experiments.  Suddenly gripped`with an overwhelming loathing `for his Father\'s abuse, his `deep rooted hatred for his `brother for the loss of his `mother and the betrayal by his`loved, Mujaki swept into `action and bloodily tore these`objects of his torment `asunder.  ``His mind wracked with what he `had committed, Mujaki ran from`his house into the night `streets of Erudin, his mind `lost to a frenzy of emotion.  `As he ran, Terris Thule guided`his step to miss-place and `with a shriek, Mujaki fell `headlong into a side ally, his`own blade, bloody with gore of`his family, tore through his `midsection.  It took a long `time for Mujaki\'s life force `to ebb from his torn body as `his mind wracked in spasms of `calamity and insanity.``Mujaki\'s essence was caught up`and trapped by The Dream `Scorcher, Terris Thule.  She `played upon Mujaki\'s `inadequacy and twisted his `direction to reaping the `essences of those he now feels`are beneath him, in his own `twisted logic.  Finding power `in undeath, Mujaki the `Devourer is the scourge of `weak willed dreamers.  His ego`is now stoked by the legions `of nightmares he sends forth `to collect essences for `Terris\' torments.  It is `unknown what it would take to `free Mujaki and ultimately `place his spirit to rest.'),

Here we remain`- for how long I cannot say.`Day 1`Our tiny room appears to have `been used as a storage area, `there are many materials here.` Perhaps some will come in `useful in our escape.  ``My wards of protection are `about the room, it should `remain soundproof for some `time.  The door looks strong. `We both need rest.`Day 2`Within the mounds of jumble, I`found a strange ore.  It seems`local to this area\'s geology -`and has fascinating `properties.  ``Using my firestaff as a `makeshift forge, I found that `two lumps of this ore could be`enchanted with a vial of `distilled mana - interesting.`Day 3`Kinopio is keeping me awake `with his nightmares.  ``Thankfully, we appear to be `undiscovered.  I hear female `screams after dark.'),
	('NCTbook3', 'Day 4`The enchanted ore seems to `bond well with certain jewels `that I have with me: diamonds,`blue diamonds, sapphires, `black sapphires and rubies.``I shall remember to note these`for further investigation on `our return to the Academy.```Day 5`Our rations are low.  Kinopio,`bless his brave Gnomish soul, `dared to step outside the room`today.  He was gone for some `time, and came back with - `well, with a dead Tae Ew `runtling.``The door is secured again. I `wonder if we dare cook this `lizard?`Day 6`Hunger is a cruel thing.  `Kinopio went to work on `cooking the runtling this `morning.``It tastes so good!  Cooked on `a skewer, with a little spice `and some sauce, this lizard `meat is most pleasing.  `Kinopio ate meat rolled in `batwing - such an odd gnome.`Day 7`Gods, a week has passed.  `Kinopio\'s nightmares are `worse, they are effecting his `judgement.``My day was spent curing the `hide of the runtling - a long `process, using a vial of the `poor creature\'s blood.  The `result is a hard leather - `perhaps I can put it to use.`Day 8`Kinopio is restless, so I put `him to work with the cured `hide.  He has hidden talents: `from one section of hide he `created a tough belt for `himself, and from another `section of hide he produced a `gorget.  Amazing.``Today\'s meal consisted of raw `lizard sandwich.  Revolting.`Day 9`Kinopio discovered a barrel, `suitable for brewing, in one `of the piles that line the `walls.  Using two vials of the`runtlings blood and a single `vial of distilled mana, I `managed to distill the `substance into a thick, `viscous fluid.``I shall investigate tomorrow.`Day 10`Kinopio\'s skills know no `bound.  Using the distilled `blood and two sections of the `hardened hide, he created a `backpack the likes of which I `have never seen before.``From two portions of the `distilled blood, a section of `hide and a whip pattern of his`own he even made a rudimentary`weapon.  ``Our meal today consisted of a `soup - lizard meat in water `from the drain, with a little `sauce, in Kinopio\'s pot. Ugh.'),
	('NCTbook4', 'Day 11`The day went slowly.  Kinopio `and I discussed possible uses `for this cured hide.  He seems`to think that one could `fashion an entire suit of `armour from it, simply using `sections of the cured hide in `various quantity with an `appropriate pattern.``I slept most of the day.`Day 12`Woke in the middle of the `night to Kinopio screaming.  I`must admit that my dreams have`not been too pleasant lately `either.``In a fit of creativity, `Kinopio created us a crude pie`made from the now-festering `lizard meat and a little `dough, in his pie tin. `Day 13`Kinopio tells me that he used `to be a smith of some reknown `in his youth.  I find it easy `to believe.``He spent all afternoon laying `out plans for a set of `chain-mail: a mold, a vial of `the distilled blood, and `several sheets of metal.  If `only we had sheets of metal!`Day 14`What a day.  It started so `well - from a scale temper and`a vial of the lizard\'s blood `(thankfully still in good `condition after all this time `due to my preservations), I `created a lizard blood temper.` `Then Kinopio passed out.  He `shows no signs of `consciousness.`Day 15`We have survived two weeks.  `The runtling was rotting so `severely that I had to `vapourise it - hopefully my `magics kept the sound `contained.``Kinopio still lies comatose, `as if in a state of `near-death.  I wish that `Felwah were here to cure him.`Day 16`Kinopio awakened!  His eyes `are bloodshot, he does not `look well even to my limited `medical knowledge. ``The stirrings outside the door`have become more pronounced `over the last days, since `Kinopio was unconscious, as if`hundreds of rats were out `there.`Day 17`Though ill, Kinopio has gone `to work with a will.  Using my`lizard-blood temper, he `hammered two pristine lizard `scales together to form a `larger plate - it looks `exceptionally tough, perhaps `we can use it to escape.``I cooked lizard in a little `frosting, with spice - superb.`Day 18`The noises outside are more `evident than ever.  Kinopio `keeps wanting to open the `door.'),
	('NCTbook5', 'Day 19`My Gnomish companion has `become obsessed with opening `the door - I turn my back to `find him edging towards it `with a distant look in his `eyes.``My sleep has been restless.  `Sometimes it sounds as if the `very walls of the temple `itself are whispering to me.`Day 20`Kinopio showed me plans for a `suit of full plate armour, `based on the lizard plating `that he constructed several `days ago.``With a smithing hammer, flask `of water, leather padding, `mold and several of the lizard`platings, he claims to be able`to make anything.`Day 21`Kinopio woke before me and ran`out of the door.  He was gone `all morning, and appeared `soaked in blood and sweat in `the afternoon.  ``Locking the door behind him, `he sat in a corner, staring `into space, clutching a `strange silk substance in his `hand.`Day 22`Kinopio sleeps, fitfully.``From two of the strands of the`silk, smeared in some form of `unidentifiable ichor, I was `able to make a crude swatch of`silk.  From whatever creature `this originates, I would `rather not know - it is `strong, and yet flexible.  `Inordinately so.`Day 23`I fear for Kinopio\'s mental `state, he appears to have gone`quite insane.  Whilst `constantly gibbering about `some kind of sacrifice, his `skilled hands crafted `something from the silk swatch`and a pattern of his own `making - imagine my surprise `when the poor soul presented `me with a hand-sewn cap!  `Day 24`A transformation has occured `in my companion.  His former `state of incoherence and `madness has been replaced by a`firm determinism.  He seems `resolved, though in what I `cannot say.``The cap fits well - it seems `logical that the silk can be `used to make other garments.`Day 25`I awoke to find Kinopio gone. `Where he is I cannot guess, `though the door remains `locked.``The scurrying sounds outside `the door become almost `unbearable in the silence of `the room.  I must stay, I must`wait.. help could be on its `way...`Day 26`I can stand it no longer.``I will find Kinopio, and `together we shall escape.``The door opens?'),

In fact, because`of their extreme lack of`intelligence, they have been`abused in trades by just`about every merchant in`Norrath. If one were to`wonder why the citizens of`Highkeep permit the clan to`live in the mines beneath`their homes, the answer is`quite simple, they are good`miners and they trade the`ores cheaply.``The goblins would slave day`in and day out looking for`the "shiny rocks" for which`the stupid humans gave`them coin. The fact that`these same rocks actually`made the coin is a feature`that has escaped them`thus far.``In addition to the humans of`Highkeep, the goblins also`make secret trades with both`the Teir\'Dal of Neriak and`the Koada\'Dal of Faydwer.`The Teir\'Dal would reward`the goblins with decent arms`and generally paid the best.`They were dangerous to deal`with as they were just as`likely to kill you as pay`you.  Trading with the`Koada\'Dal was rather`uncommon. The Koada\'Dal`only came seeking the few`rare stones they used to`create their arcane runes,`which was fine for the`pickclaws as no one else`wanted those dull looking`rocks.``The pickclaw miner Nurgal`was on par intellectually`with of the rest his clan.`Nurgal was quite happy this`day as he had found a new`vein in his section of the`mines. In fact, he\'d already`pulled three shiny yellow`bricks today and was sure`to get at least a fistful of`copper for them!  After`chipping a few more layers`he hit something very hard`with his pick, so hard that`his pick bent.  ``"Whaza!" he exclaimed.  ``In the crevice he revealed`was a slightly glowing blue`rock.  "Hmm," he thought,`"me never seen a blue rock`afore."  He tried chipping`at a little bit more but`could not even put a scratch`into it.  Finally in a`display of rare brilliance,`and after ruining several`more tools, he decided to`carve around the rock and`yank it out.``The rock was spherical in`shape, about 8 inches in`diameter.  Nurgal\'s eyes`gleamed with a dull brilliance`as he guessed how many`allies he could buy with`this rare find.`He quickly concealed`it in his belt pouch, wary as`always that some of the`larger goblins might see it`and take it from him.  He`quickly scrambled out of the`hole he was working in and`started off to the city to`find the dark elf ambassador.`The dark elves had always`given Nurgal the best prices`for rare finds, and this`would be no exception he`decided.`'),
	('nurglestone2', 'Tyrana Slil was quite pleased`with Nurgal, especially since`he swore that he brought this`new find straight to her`without telling anyone else.`As one of the Teir\'Dal`ambassadors in Highkeep, it`was Tyrana\'s job to be both`spy and broker for materials`gained in the keep.  Although`Tyrana enjoyed the dark end`of her work, she really`wanted to be back in Neriak.`Working with these lesser`races day in and day out`was, after all, beneath her`standards. She thought, "And`thanks to this stupid`creature, I may just have a`ticket back there."``"So, u pay me big?" he asked`with a disgustingly lustful`gaze.``"Sweet sweet Nurgal, you\'ve`been so kind to me, how can`I ever repay you? More wine?"`Gods how she hated having to`play the role of seductress`to this loathsome creature,`but nevertheless, her tactics`were effective. Nurgal gulped`the wine, most of which ended`up on his gut, and seemed`most pleased with himself.`"Now, let us see just what`kind of properties this find`of yours has." ``She had the orb centered on`the table, although she was`not the most practiced`geologist, as a necromancer`of Innoruuk she did have`some powerful identification`spells at her disposal.  As`she finished her minor`enchantment there was a`bright flash of blue light`and a burning sensation that`caused her to jump back,`shrieking.  Nurgal promptly`jumped under the table`wanting no part of the dark`elf\'s wrath that was sure to`follow.  ``But instead of draining`Nurgal\'s life as she stared`at her now burnt fingertips,`Tyrana begin to cackle with`unabashed glee.  "By`Innoruuk\'s hand this is no`mere metal! Its magic`properties alone are the`strongest I\'ve seen!"`Realizing that his mistress`was happy again Nurgal pulled`himself up from the floor`and smiled.  "Nurgal. Are`there more of these where`you found this one, in the`mines?" she asked.  ``"Umm, me not know,but`usually when me find one`type of shiny rock me find`more later," he replied.  ``"I must get both this rock`and this information to`Neriak at once," Tyrana`thought to herself,  "But,`before I leave, I must have`this wretched creature show`me where he found this, so`I can be done with him."``After Nurgal was appropriately`intoxicated, Tyrana tried to`convince the goblin to show`her where it was he found`this vein of strange blue ore.`Nurgal was hesitant to reveal`the location of his find to`the dark elf but after Tyrana`offered him a sizeable`reward, the goblin finally`agreed. Calling for a guard`from the keep to escort them,`Tyrana followed Nurgal down`into the mines where he`revealed the location of the`strange blue vein of ore.``Tyrana was very pleased with`Nurgal\'s find and`complimented the goblin`on a job well done.`After inspecting the vein of`ore, Tyrana turned to the`goblin and grinned, her hands`began to glow with a pale`green light.``Nurgal jumped in fear as the`magic began to swirl and`build around Tyrana. The`coarse hair on the goblin\'s`body began to bristle with`the building energy. Ducking`his head, Nurgal blathered,`"What you doing, You not`hurt Nurgal now?"``Tyrana continued to smile at`the goblin and said in a`sweet voice, "Why Nurgal!`I\'m not going to hurt you,`I\'m simply creating your`reward!" No sooner had the`Teir\'Dal uttered these words`did she draw away the full`sum of Nurgal\'s lifeforce.`With a pitiful squeal, the`goblin slumped to the ground,`a dry and empty husk.`Tyrana laughed.`'),
	('nurglestone3', 'Concealing the large blue`sphere in her packs she`prepared to journey back to`Neriak to report of her find.`Tyrana sought out Grigog,`Bgug, Saag, and Glunn a`group of Orcs of the`Shralok clan.`Tyrana often used these four`as escorts for her journeys`between Neriak and Highkeep.`Though she always paid the`orcs well for their services,`they were always willing to`help protect "bootifal"`Tyrana Slil and likely would`do the job free of charge. ``Grigog was the leader of the`mercenaries, slightly bigger`then the others and a rather`powerful shaman to boot.`Bgug was the most`demented of the Orcs`and delighted in the torture`of his already dead`opponents. He would usually`cut small openings into`different parts of the body`trying to guess the identity`of certain anatomical parts.`He would do this until Grigog`kicked him in the back of`the head, breaking his`morbid trance.``Saag was easily one of the`biggest and dumbest orcs in`the lands. He was utterly`useless when given`complicated orders but`once someone gave`him a target it was assured`that it would stand no more,`be it human or inanimate`object. When not fighting he`enjoyed staring into empty`space and drooling. Glunn`was another matter altogether.`He was as happy-go-lucky as`an orc could be. He was`celebrating his 12th birthday`but because he could not`remember exactly when he`was born, he had been`celebrating his birthday for`several days now and planned`to continue celebrating it`for a few more, just to be`safe.``Tyrana was very good at`ignoring the orcs. She cared`only that they were strong`fighters and were fiercely`loyal to her. They proved`their usefulness to her once`again that day.``The group met with some`minor resistance along their`way to Neriak, in the form`of some humans that`assumed the worst upon`seeing a dark elf being`escorted by a group`of rather large orcs. Saag`and Glunn were left behind`in the battle as the`remaining three slipped away`during the commotion. Saag`and Glunn were presumed to`have been slain during the`conflict. Tyrana could have`cared less for the sacrifice`of her protectors. From that`point onward, they moved`quickly as word spread of`their travels and further`resistance began. Tyrana`and the remaining orcs were`soon joined by other curious`Teir\'Dal who, ever loyal to`their own, helped to drive`back the attackers.``With her now rather large`retinue of curious Teir\'Dal`and others friendly to the`dark elven cause, they`arrived in Neriak Commons.`There, Tyrana met with`Laarthik K\'Shin and they`proceeded to go to the Neriak`Academy of Lesser Magics.`She handed the stone to`Laarthik, whispering quietly`with him as the crowd of`onlookers looked on`curiously.`'),
	('nurglestone4', 'Turning the stone over in his`hand a few times, Laarthik`K\'Shin looked to Tyrana and`said in a stern voice, "Very`well Tyrana. You may return`to Highpass at this time."``Shocked at being ordered back`to the place she disliked,`even in the face of this`momentous discovery, she`began to protest, "Surely you`will not send me back to the`den of humanity! The place`reeks of those sightless`fools and the filthy`creatures that war daily with`them! Does not my discovery`earn me the right to be freed`from such lowly duty?"``His face twisting in disgust,`Laarthik shot back, "Hold`your tongue woman before`I remove it from your head!`As a member of an`insignificant and non-noble`house, you have no \'right\' to`anything! You will do as you`are told and be happy that`you are allowed to serve us."``Moving sharply, he wrote`upon a parchment with quick,`jagged motions. Thrusting the`parchment toward Tyrana, he`barked, "Here are your orders.`Leave me at once."``Removing a bag from his vest,`he scattered a pile of gold`coins upon the table behind`him and said, "Those loyal`brethren that wish to escort`Tyrana back to High Keep`may take their payment now."`Turning quickly, he marched`from the room.``Mouth agape, Tyrana stood in`shock for a moment. Then,`snarling to herself Tyrana`strode indignantly from the`Academy, her escorts`following close behind.``The Wood Elves are thought`by some, to be the least`active race on Norrath,`content with living their`lives in their beloved forest`fighting off the occasional`Orc incursion. This is far`from the truth however.`Tunare\'s Martyrs have many`operatives throughout Faydark`and Antonica, even keeping`one stationed in Erudin.`Felinin Deepwood was the`Highkeep operative and was`charged with keeping tabs on`the Teir\'Dal actions within.`He was young for his rank`and eager to please his`superiors and Tunare. For`weeks his main target,`Tyrana, had done nothing but`buy various types of ore from`the goblins and make a few`shady deals with the local`Merchants. ``Word of Tyrana Slil\'s strange`and sudden journey to Neriak`convinced him that the`Teir\'Dal were up to`something terrible. He`made the decision that`he would take action,`figure out what was going`on, and try to stop them.`He gathered those folk`in the area that were willing`to help stop the Teir\'Dal`and began to lay plans`for an ambush. `'),

We are under`attack!"``Suddenly, the forest was`alive with arrows flying, the`sound of metal clanging`against metal. Everything was`electric as spells were`channeled and great`explosions erupted sending`lifeless bodies sailing`through the air. Drawing`forth her dagger, she faced`off with Felinin, a feral`snarl flashing across her`face.``Lunging forward to stab`the Wood Elf in the chest,`Felinin dodged easily and`slashed with his scimitar`seriously wounding`Tyrana\'s leg. Suddenly`fearful for her life, Tyrana`began to call upon the dark`art of Necromancy to steal`the precious life energy of`the Fier\'Dal and heal her`grave wound. Felinin\'s`attacks were relentless and`the dark elf was not able to`channel forth the energy`necessary to complete her`spell. A final cruel blow to`her chest sent Tyrana Slil`reeling.

You see, she spends `many days out in the meadows `creating artwork, sewing `dresses, and enjoying the `outdoors. She is a true `artisan. Her current sewing `kit is quite bulky, so I have `been inspired to create a more`portable way for her to be `able to enjoy her craft. I `have created a container, `which at the desire of the `user, will compact onto itself`and fit nicely into any `backpack. I achieved this by `taking a handful of metal `bits. I pressed them into the `thimble, needle, container `base, and container lid molds `that I purchased from the `blacksmith down the road. Once`the thimble, needle, `container, and lid were `complete, I took some gnomish `bolts to rivet the container `together in a fashion that it `could be collapsed. I then `took a coiled spring to attach`the lid to the container. She `was very pleased with the kit,`and uses it every time she `goes out to sew.  My friend `Klen saw her unfolding the `sewing kit for use and seemed `very interested. He offered a `months supply of his wonderful`cheese if I would make him `one, but so that he could use `it to mix ingredients to cook `with while out camping in the `wild. Being a fond lover of `cheese I took him up on his `offer and got to work! Making `the collapsing bowl was easier`than the sewing kit. All I had`to do was take four folded `sheets of metal (I am becoming`a regular customer of the `blacksmiths it seems) and `rivet them together with some `gnomish bolts. I then took a `coiled spring and attached it `so that the bowl will compact `on itself more easily. The `four metal sheets then spread `out very nicely to form a bowl`shape for Klen to work with.'),

The collapsible spit `was fairly easy to make.  I `took three metal rods and `bolted them together with some`gnomish bolts.

I am but a humble`Paladin of Mithaniel Marr,`born like many of our kind`in the swamps of Southern`Antonica, and deserve no`adulation for penning these`words.  This work is in`honor of all Froglok,`current, past, and yet to`come.``In the early ages of`Norrath, before the arrival`of Man, the Marr Twins did`walk the face of Norrath.`The children of a God of`Power, Tarrew Marr the Water`Lord, the Marr Twins`searched amongst the mortals`of Norrath a cause to`champion and embrace with`their divinity. The Gods of`Nature puzzled over the Marr`Twins absence of a divine`purpose, and the Gods of`Influence scoffed at the`twins for seeking such a`purpose amongst the`mortals. The most malicious`of the Gods, Innoruuk, and`Cazic-Thule, sought to`corrupt the young twins to`strengthen the forces of`hatred and fear.``Innoruuk, the twisted God`of Hatred and Spite sent`his mortal followers to`Tarrews daughter, Erollisi`Marr, to tempt her and`seduce her into the`darkness. With the wisdom`imparted to the Goddess by`her father, she saw through`the Teir\'Dals deceptions,`and their wickedness was`more visible to her eyes`than even their physical`forms. So it came to pass`that Erollisi journeyed to`the lands of Tunare\'s fair`elves, to escape the`sickening advances of the`Teir\'Dal. It was in the`early kingdoms of the elves,`that Erollisi did find`warmth, peace, and beauty`in the harsh realm of the`mortals and it was there`that she embraced and was`in return embraced by a`most mortal of traits. It`was there she found love.``While Erollisi fended off`the advances of Innoruuks`mortal agents, the forces of`Cazic-Thule beset her twin`brother, Mithaniel Marr.`Serpents, phantoms, and all`manner of frightful creatures`conjured and commanded by`Cazic-Thules mortal minions`came to Mithaniel to assault`his body and mind. Mithaniel`was no mortal however, and`his will is strong, the`minions of Thule could not`instill within him the fear`of their dark lord. They did`succeed however, in luring`the brave Mithaniel to the`swamps of Norrath, the`deadly, dank, lands where`the creatures of Cazic-Thule`were the strongest and most`numerous. An army of`Trolls, Lizard Folk, and`forgotten creatures of`unspeakable horror beset`Mithaniel Marr, and so it`came to pass that he became`a captive to the minions of`the Lord of Fear.``Mithaniel, imprisoned in`magical bonds provided to`his captors by Cazic-Thule,`and tortured by relentless`monstrosities, prayed to his`father day and night for`forgiveness and salvation.`The prayers continued,`unanswered, until the brave`God, weary from torture`and weakened by the dark`magic of Cazic-Thule fell`into a deep slumber.``It was then that Terris-Thule`visited the slumbering God`to inflict his sleep with`nightmares more horrible`than the events he had`endured at the hands of`his captors during his`waking hours. However, at`the beseeching of her father,`Cazic-Thule, Terris was not`permitted to inflict such`terror onto Mithaniel Marr`until after she first`deceived him through his`dreams and stole the gift of`life from his body. So Terris`did as her father commanded`and then the slumbering`horrors began.`'),
	('PondPaladin2', '`Morell-Thule, the forsaken`son of Cazic, and brother of`Terris, took notice of Terris`manipulations of the`slumbering God, for while`Terris is the Queen of`Nightmares, Morell is the`King of Dreams. For reasons`unknown, perhaps simply to`foul the plans of his wicked`father and sister,`Morell-Thule stole the gift`of life that had been taken`from the slumbering`Mithaniel and escaped into`his Demi-Plane of Dreams.`Knowing that his enraged`family would soon visit his`home, Morell divided`Mithaniels Gift of Life,`scattering one half across`all the swamps of Norrath,`the sacred lands of his`father, Cazic-Thule.` `Where Mithaniels Gift of`Life fell upon the swamps`of Norrath, the first Froglok`Tads were born. Those first`Tads had the hardest trials`of our people. Until that`point, the swamps belonged`only to the foul and`destructive creatures of the`dark gods. Fortunately the`gift of life that had brought`our first ancestors into`being also empowered them`with the bravery and valor`Mithaniel Marr had`exhibited during his trials`in the mortal realms.``Once the swamps had been`seeded with the first of our`kind, the Lord of Dreams,`Morell-Thule, visited`Mithaniel Marr\'s twin`sister, Erollisi Marr. While`the Goddess of Love`blissfully rested in the`lands of the fair elves,`Morell-Thule visited her in`a dream and gave to her the`second half of Mithaniel\'s`Gift of Life. It was soon to`be evident to the fair elves`that their visiting daughter`of the Gods was with child`and they took her to an`uninhabited region of the`frozen northlands of`Antonica, where they could`tend to and guard her in`seclusion.``While the elves watched`after Erollisi, the first of`our ancestors grew from`Tads into adult Frogloks,`and Morell-Thule gifted`them with dreams of the`imprisoned Mithaniel Marr,`and visions of a means to`free the brave son of`Tarrew. So it came to pass`that from all the swamps of`Norrath, the first Frogloks`rose in arms against the`minions of Cazic-Thule,`fighting valiantly to the`site of Mithaniel Marrs`imprisonment, guided by`visions from the Lord of`Dreams.``For uncounted years the`Frogloks battled the evil`inhabitants of Norraths`swamplands, learning the`lessons of both victory and`defeat. Alas, Cazic-Thule`is an ancient and powerful`God and his minions are`numerous and diverse. Try`as they might, the ancestor`Frogloks could not reach`their imprisoned God, but`never did they cease their`efforts, despite the`daunting odds.``Then, after some time, a`small army arrived on the`borders of the swamp that`was Mithaniel Marrs prison.`Not an army of Frogloks,`but an army of Northmen,`the children of Erollisi`Marr. They too had been`guided by visions and dreams`of the imprisoned God from`whose life they were`conceived. Seeking justice`for the imprisonment of their`father, the Northmen joined`with the Froglok armies and`the alliance of Froglok and`Man succeeded in freeing`their father Mithaniel Marr.`The minions of Cazic-Thule`and the Avatar of Fear`himself fell before the`unity and valor of the`children of Marr. For the`first time in the history of`Norrath, the swamps were`not safe for the evil`creations of the dark gods.``It was in the brave and`selfless actions of the`ancestor Frogloks and`Northmen that Mithaniel`Marr discovered the mortal`trait of Valor, and because`of Morell-Thule\'s honorable`delivering of the truth of`our origins to our ancestors`in visions and dream,`Mithaniel also chose to`champion the virtue of`honesty as well as valor.``Such is the tale of my`Lord Mithaniel Marr, and`the origins of my fellow`Frogloks, and of our distant`brethren, the race of Men.`It is a shame that so many`of our kind, as well as`many of the race of men,`have strayed from the`virtues of our ancestors.`May Mithaniel Marr bless`us, his faithful servants,`with the powers to redeem`our fallen kin from the`clutches of evil.`'),

According to the `prophecies, The Wun shall`subjugate all clans under one`rule.`The might of The Wun and`the united clans under his`rule shall be unstoppable, all`of Norrath shall be ours to `plunder, all its inhabitants `ours to torture and feast `upon.`The shaman of the old `clans recorded the prophecies `of The Grozmok on the `strongest slab of stone, the `hieroglyphs drawn with their `own blood and blessed by the `Gods of Fear and Hate. For `ages our ancestor shaman `guarded the stone, while our `ancestor warriors sought to `subjugate their rival clans, `each hoping to become the `legendary Grozmok.

During this time the `Grozmok Stone was lost, `pillaged and hidden within one`of the strongholds of the `Rallosian Empire.`The Empire of the Ogres `fell abruptly, cursed by the `Gods to be reduced lower than`the state peoples they had `conquered. The remnants of `the ancestor clans once again `began to flourish, new clans `rose to replace those that had`been lost to the slaughter of `the Rallosian Empire. Two `tribes in particular gained `dominance of the ancestor `Trolls, the Brokenskull Clan `who inhabit an Island in the `Gulf of Gunthak, and the `Ykesha Clan residing in the `Innothule Swamps.

	('VelArmor1', 'Royal Forge of Icewell`Arms Set.12-Royal Field Plate`------------------------------`The field plate of the Coldain`Royal Armory is lightweight `and good for any expedition `where battle may occur.  The `following are the summarized `steps of the process:``1. To start you will need to `first hammer out the folded `sheets of velium that the `armor is constructed from.  `Place a Block of Velium in the`forge, as it becomes more `malleable begin to hammer it `flat with a Velium Smithy `Hammer.  When flat pour some `Coldain Velium Temper onto the`sheet.  Fold the sheet over on`top of itself and hammer it `down flat once again.``2. Now begin to work on the `Velium Rings that will link `the pieces of the armor `together.  To make a set of `rings, place a Large Brick of `Velium into the forge and heat`it up a bit.  Take a metal `file and file off small pieces`and shape them into a circular`shape.  Cool them in a Vial of`Coldain Velium Temper to `strengthen them.``3. Take a break from the hot `forge and prepare to fashion `the Soft Fur Padding which `will be placed on the inside `of the armor.  The fur will `serve as comfort and to keep `the body warm.  The softest `fur is found from Velium `Hounds, take a patch of their `fur and sew it into patterns `that will fit inside the `armor, use Silver Thread to `accomplish this.``4. The preparations are now `complete.  You can now begin `to fashion the armor.  Use a `Velium Smithy Hammer to `hammer the Folded Velium `Sheets into a Plate Mold.  `Once the Sheet has been `hammered into the mold, begin `attaching the Velium Rings to `the outer areas of the armor `piece that will connect to `other pieces.  Then begin `attaching the Soft Fur Padding`to the insides of the armor `piece.  For creating the `Bracer and Boots you will need`one Folded Velium Sheet.  For `the Vambraces, Gauntlets, and `Helmet you will need two `Folded Velium Sheets.  For the`Breastplate, and Greaves you `will need three Folded Velium `Sheets to fill the mold.'),
	('VelArmor2', 'Royal Forge of Icewell `Precious Gem Study V.1`----------------------`Now that the armor is created `you can begin to set a gem `within it.  We have found `three gems that when faceted `will seem to add an aura that `radiates from the armor.  It `is our firm belief that Brell `himself is pleased with the `fusion of Ore and Mineral and `bestows powers unto the armor.` Three different gems are used`in the process of creating `this armor: Diamonds, `Emeralds, and Sapphires.  `These are not normal gems that`circulate through the economy;`these are gems pulled from the`raw ore and faceted to draw `upon its powers.  To facet the`unrefined gem you will first `need a set of etching tools to`chip away the raw edges. Place`the gem firmly in your jewelry`kit and slowly chip away at `all sides until a nice smooth `edge is formed.  When you have`finished with the lapidary `place the piece of armor you `wish to work on in your `jewelry kit.  Use your etching`tools to form a base for the `gem to fit in.  Then place the`gem in the base you just `created and you are finally `done.  The optimum effect of `gems has been found as the `follows: Diamonds for the `Breastplate and Greaves, `Sapphires for the Vambraces `and Bracers, and Emeralds for `the Boots, Gauntlets, and `Helmets.'),

	('ZeroBG', 'Before Green `This is known as the Age `of the Snake. The snake `race known as Shissar, `slithered upon Kunark.`The Iksar had yet to `unite. Our people had yet`to learn the Black Arts and`the ways of Fist and Tail.`Divided, the Iksar were`enslaved by the snakes.`In the centuries before the`Green, the Iksar were `slaves of the Shissar `They ruled from the ancient`city of Chelsith which rested`deep within the land now `known as The Overthere.`From there would sprout much`evil. The Iksar were `tortured like Frogs and`suffered at the hands of`the Shissar. The Iksar who`showed genius were to help`the snakes in their dark `rites. These few were the `seeds of rebellion. The`Iksar began to plot a `revolt, but a greater force`would strike first. The `Shissar were an arrogant `race. The power bestowed by`the gods was not enough. `They made pacts with other `gods and demigods. They `found the rifts of time and`space and used them to `gather magic items once `held by the guardians of`the planes. The Shissar\'s`disloyalty and blasphemous`pride would bring the wrath`of the gods upon them. No`power could stop the force `to come. A green cloud `formed in the skies above`Kunark. The cloud began to`descend upon the land. From`its green core the face `of death began to form. It`was of no god they knew.`It opened its giant maw `and spoke in tongues `unknown. From the mouth of`death rushed forth a green`mist. The Shissar shamans `began to cast spells in `hopes of shielding their `city and the necromancers `began to assault the mist `with great spells. All were`futile. The mist rushed `forth. The first snakes to`be swallowed by the mist `had their scales and flesh`rot and fall from their`bones. Horrid screams of`suffering could be heard`from within the mist. A river`of flesh and blood flowed.`The Iksar stood and gazed`upon the gristle that was`once the Shissar. With the`Green Death came the `liberation of the Iksar.`The season is now 0 A.G.,`After Green.'),
